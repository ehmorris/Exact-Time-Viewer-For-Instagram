### About

This is a simple Chrome Extension that displays the exact time an Instagram was posted, rather than a date or some time ago.

[Available on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/exact-time-viewer-for-ins/koffnfmgjmoopfgelgbbkjmdnppadlae).

### Development

Reload the extension via Chrome when testing.

To generate a build, use Chrome’s “Pack Extension” button on `chrome://extensions` and attach the private key from previous packaged versions.
